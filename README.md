# Day-5
Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forest

This project applies decision tree and random forest classifiers on the Heart Disease dataset to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook

## Models Implemented
- Decision Tree Classifier (with and without depth pruning)
- Random Forest Classifier

## Key Learnings
- Visualized decision tree structure
- Compared performance of tree-based models
- Analyzed feature importance
- Applied cross-validation for evaluation

## Accuracy
- Decision Tree: ~82%
- Pruned Tree: ~84%
- Random Forest: ~87%

## Dataset Source
[Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
